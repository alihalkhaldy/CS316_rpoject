# Crop Yield Prediction

This project aims to predict crop yields using machine learning techniques. It uses a Kaggle dataset that includes various features related to crop production, such as climate, soil, and region data. The models trained in this project are based on multiple machine learning algorithms to predict crop yield and evaluate model performance.

## Project Overview

The project is built using Python and uses popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, and others for regression tasks. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains agricultural data that is processed and used for training models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Crop Yield Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrigaankjaswal/crop-yield-prediction-dataset), available on Kaggle. It includes features related to crop production such as region, temperature, and rainfall, along with historical crop yields.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `scikit-learn` for various regression models and model evaluation
- `xgboost` and `catboost` for gradient boosting models
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `kagglehub` for accessing Kaggle datasets in the notebook environment

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-yield-prediction.git
