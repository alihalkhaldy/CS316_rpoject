# Crop Yield Prediction

This project is a machine learning model to predict crop yields using data obtained from Kaggle. It leverages popular machine learning frameworks and libraries such as TensorFlow, SciKeras, and sklearn, along with advanced regression and ensemble methods.

## Features

- **Data Source**: Kaggle Dataset (`mrigaankjaswal/crop-yield-prediction-dataset`)
- **Machine Learning Models**: RandomForest, GradientBoosting, LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, and custom TensorFlow models via SciKeras.
- **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.

## Setup
